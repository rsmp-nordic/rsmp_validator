# Helper class for testing RSMP sites
#
# The class is a singleton g class, meaning there will only ever be
# one instance.
#
# The class runs an RSMP supervisor (which the site connects to)
# inside an Async reactor. To avoid waiting for the site to connect
# for every test, the supervisor and the connection to the site
# is maintained across test.
#
# However, the reactor is paused between tests, to give RSpec a chance
#
# Only one site is expected to connect to the supervisor. The first
# site connecting will be the one that tests communicate with.
#
# to run.
#
# Each RSpec test is run inside a separate Async task.
# Exceptions in you test code will be cause the test task to stop,
# and re-raise the exception ourside the reactor so that RSpec
# sees it.
#
# The class provides a few methods to wait for the site to connect.
# These methods all take a block, which is where you should put
# you test code.
#
# RSpec.describe "Traffic Light Controller" do
#   it 'my test' do |example|
#     Validator::Site.connected do |task,supervisor,site|
#       # your test code goes here
#     end
#   end
# end

# The block will pass an RSMP::SiteProxy object,
# which can be used to communicate with the site. For example
# you can send commands, wait for responses, subscribe to statuses, etc.

   # class methods that just calls the instance stored in Validator
