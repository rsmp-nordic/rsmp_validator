  # Testing alarms require a reliable way of rainsing them.

  # There's no way to trigger alarms directly via RSMP yet,

  # when a specific input is activated. If that's the case,
  # set the `alarm_activcation` item in the validator config to
  # specify which input activates which alarm. See docs for details.

  # Triggered alarms manually on the equipment is not used,
  # because validator is meant for automated testing.
