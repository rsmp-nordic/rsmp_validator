# Test Suite
The validator includes a suite of tests covering most aspects of the RSMP protocol.

Tests are organized into tests for sites and supervisors.

Testing of supervisors is still preliminary and only a few tests are available.

Testing of sites is split into tests covering the general Core specification and tests for Traffic Light Controllers.

The site core tests can be used to check the basic RSMP functionality of all types of RSMP equipment, but is by nature  limited to the core RSMP functionality. The can't test any commands, statuses or alarms, because these are defined in the SXL of each equipment type.
