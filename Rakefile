# Rake tasks for updating documentation.
# We use the branch gh-pages as the publishing source on GitHub Pages,
# and the Rake tasks commit to this branch.
#
# When updating gh-pages from master, we use --no-overlay to ensure that deleted files are removed, see:
# https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout#Documentation/git-checkout.txt---no-overlay

Build documentation with YARD. \
Updates YARD docs based on relevant folders in spec/ and commits the result to the gh-pages branch.\

	system 'bundle exec yardoc'
	system 'git checkout gh-pages'
	system 'git add .'
	system 'git status'

# Note that rebuilding with YARD does not delete unused files.
# For this reason, it's often a good idea to delete the output folder before rebuilding, using:
# % rm -r docs/tests
