# This file is a template.
# Copy it to config/validator.yaml and edit the copy to
# point to the config for the system you're testing
# You only need either a site or a supervisor key. The right
# one will be picked depending on what specs you run.
# But you can leave both, the unused key will just be ignored.

# when testing a site, the config describes the local supervisor
site: config/gem_tlc.yaml

# when testing a supervisor, the config describes the local site
supervisor: config/gem_supervisor.yaml

# Optional: Auto Node Feature
# Automatically start a local site/supervisor to test instead of an external one.
# This is useful when developing the RSMP gem or the test suite itself.
# The auto node runs inside the same Async reactor as the validator.

# Uncomment to automatically start a local site for testing:
# auto_site: config/simulator/tlc.yaml

# Uncomment to automatically start a local supervisor for testing:
# auto_supervisor: config/simulator/supervisor.yaml
