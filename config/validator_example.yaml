# This file is template.
# Copy it to config/validator.yaml and edit the copy to
# point to the config for the system you're testing
# You only need either a site or a supervisor key. The right
# one will be picked depending on what specs you run.
# But you can leave both, the unused key will just be ignored.

# when testing a site, the config describes the local supervisor
site: config/gem_site.yaml

# when testing a supervisor, the config describes the local site
supervisor: config/gem_supervisor.yaml
